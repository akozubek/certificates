Window Functions,https://learnsql.com/course/window-functions/,218.0,Standard SQL,20,Course,Learn how to use analytic SQL functions to deeply understand data.,"## Description

SQL window functions – also known as windowing functions, OVER functions, or analytic functions – are tremendously useful. These functions make building complex aggregations much simpler. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will lead you through SQL window functions. At its end, you'll embrace this topic with ease and feel comfortable using window functions in SQL databases.

Window functions are so powerful that they serve as a dividing point in time: people talk about SQL before window functions and SQL after window functions. Because they were introduced into the standard relatively recently, these functions aren't covered in many SQL courses.

Note: Most popular database engines support window functions.

Here are 100 interactive online exercises on window functions on three different real-life databases.,"Window functionsare a powerful modern addition to SQL. They allow you to prepare complex SQL reports: rankings, differences between two rows, running totals, moving averages, time series analysis, and more.

Are you dreaming of a career in data analysis? You need to know SQL window functions if you want to move freely in the modern SQL environment. This course offers a unique opportunity to practice SQL window functions interactively.

Window functions are rarely covered in a typical SQL course curriculum, and exercise sets for window functions are even more scarce. This course is designed to fill this gap in the market. To take full advantage of this course, you should know at least the basics of window functions. You don't know anything about them? Take theWindow Functionscourse first and come back for more.

This course offers multiple exercises designed to make you practice writing realistic reports using SQL window functions. Their syntax is complex and difficult to remember. You need practice to grasp the syntax and be comfortable with creating complex reports with window functions.

The course usesthree different datasets. In the first part of the course, you will work with data from anonline store. You will rank products, compute statistics for customers and their typical order size, divide customers into categories, etc. In the second part, you will deal with data fromtrack running competitions. You can find out the fastest 100m runner, the average pace for the 10000m, the country with the most medals in the women’s marathon, etc. In the third part, you will train withtraffic data from a blogof an online pet product store. You will find out which articles and article categories lead to sales the most, which author generates the biggest traffic, which articles are the most popular, when they reach the height of their popularity, etc.

We created our exercises so that you would not only practice window functions but also use the SQL queries you would actually write in your projects. The datasets and the reports are diverse and useful. It’s very likely that you will work with similar data in real life: transaction data similar to that of a store, marketing data similar to that of a blog, or achievement data in different categories similar to that of a sports competition.

The course uses thestandard SQL syntaxthat can be used in all databases that support window functions.

GROUP BY Extensions in SQL,https://learnsql.com/course/sql-group-by-extensions/,63.0,Standard SQL,7,Course,"Do you want to work more efficiently using SQL and be able to create more complex and sophisticated queries? Learn about GROUP BY clauses, such as ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS.","This online course is intended for intermediate users and benefits beginner data analysts, IT students, business developers, and more. The prerequisite is understanding the basics of SQL presented in ourSQL Basicscourse, followed by somepractice.

Do you already know the basics of SQL? It’s time to learn some of its advanced features! In this online course, you’ll learn how to use ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS operations.

ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause that allows you to attach additional lines which represent subtotals. They are often calledsuper-aggregatedrows. They can be presented together with the total sum line. Thanks to the useful ROLLUP extension, you can generate multiple grouping sets using just one SQL query.

Similar to ROLLUP, the CUBE extension allows you to generate subtotals. In addition, CUBE generates subtotals for all combinations of grouping columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.

GROUPING SETS is another step further because it allows for computing multiple GROUP BY clauses in a single SQL statement. GROUP BY GROUPING SETS is equivalent to the UNION of two or more GROUP BY operations in the same result set.

This online course consists of interactive exercises so that you can immediately gain practical experience. We designed it with the thought that it’s best to acquire knowledge through action. You can study at your own pace, and all you need is a computer, an internet connection, and a desire to learn and grow!

Window Functions in MySQL 8,https://learnsql.com/course/mysql-window-functions/,218.0,MySQL,20,Course,Want to stay up to date with the latest MySQL features? MySQL window functions are essential for doing modern data analysis. Learn how to use them to take your analysis skills to the next level!,"Want to masterMySQL window functionsand significantly increase the expressive power of your SQL queries? This course, geared for intermediate MySQL 8 users, will show you how to perform complex computations in one simple query.

Window functions were introduced to MySQL 8.0 in 2018. They immediately streamlined and facilitated the daily work of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. They are also an essential feature for anyone doing business analysis in MySQL 8 or above.

Window functions are similar to aggregate functions: they compute a value for a group of rows. In window functions, this group is called a window frame. Unlike aggregate functions and GROUP BY, window functions do not collapse rows and return one value for the entire group; they keep details of each individual row and show the group value.

In SQL, window functions let you easily process time series data (e.g. monthly financial results, daily website visits, quarterly sales totals, etc.). Use them to build SQL reports that:

- Createrankings: who the best salesperson is, what is the best-selling product, which product categories sell the least, etc.

- Computerunning totals: accumulated sales for each day of the month, how many users registered up to a certain day, etc.

- Calculatemoving averages: the weekly average sale, monthly average expenses, etc.

- Find day-to-day, month-to-month, or year-to-year differences (deltas), i.e. the increase/decrease between different time periods.

Window Functions in MySQL 8is split into multiple parts. Each part covers one aspect of window functions: the OVER() clause, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, defining window frames, etc. You will also learn different types of window functions, including:

- Aggregate functions

- Ranking functions (RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER())

- Positional functions (LEAD() and LAG())

You’ll also practice using window functions with GROUP BY. Finally, you’ll learn when to use window functions and when to use GROUP BY.

The course isinteractive. You’ll learn by writing real SQL queries in our online console and immediately seeing the results. Our platform runs your code and verifies your solution. Each exercise includes an instruction and a task that you complete. This way, you can put your new knowledge into practice right away.

If you are serious about working with databases and becoming a SQL expert, you need to know these features.

Recursive SQL queries let you process hierarchical structures (such as management hierarchies, family trees, or road connection graphs) in SQL. When you understand recursion, you can easily work with trees and graphs stored in a MySQL database.

CTEs(Common Table Expressions, also known as WITH queries), are essentially named subqueries. They let you organize your SQL query and name parts of it; this makes your work clearer and more readable. CTEs  also let you organize computations into multiple phases, which makes long queries more understandable.

Common Table Expressions and recursive queries were introduced to MySQL in 2018; they are now available in version 8.0 and higher.

Welcome to our Creating Basic SQL Reports in MS SQL Server course! Over the course of several chapters, we'll teach you how to make practical use of your SQL knowledge. You'll learn the most common types of basic SQL reports and build them step by step.

Imagine that it's 2016—Pokémon Go briefly takes over everyone's social life, and you're running a comic book store. Somewhere between asking visitors to stop playing while inside and worrying about your book sales dropping, you're planning on moving your store online. But how will you know if it's the right thing to do or if it will lead to more revenue? You won't until you crunch the numbers!

Data is collected everywhere—from marketing software counting URL clicks to sales representatives creating customer profiles and Facebook recording its users, your digital footprint is making an impact on the future of shopping all over the world. Thanks to data, we're able to measure our performance and make more informed, strategic decisions. But first, you need to know how to collect and analyze that data.

The Creating Basic SQL Reports in MS SQL Server course is divided into six parts and consists of97 practical exercisesthat you can access straight from a web browser and at your own leisure. At the end of each part, there's always a short summary quiz to check how much you remember.

As a warm up, we'll start with a quick introduction to the database model that we'll be working with in the course and review your basic SQL skills.

(Psst! If you don't feel confident with your basic SQL knowledge at this step, you can always brush up on it in ourSQL Basics in MS SQL Servercourse.)

Then, we move on to show you how to use popular SQL aggregate functions such as COUNT() or SUM() to summarize data in SQL, like counting business objects based on selected criteria or calculating total amounts based on multiple objects.

After summarizing data in SQL, we move on to show you how to classify data: how you can create custom classifications of objects in SQL using the CASE WHEN syntax and how you can use classifications to group objects in the GROUP BY clause. This course explains the intricacies of the GROUP BY clause and reviews a few typical mistakes that beginners make.

Next, we'll tackle multi-level aggregation so you know how to calculate averages of averages and how to organize longer queries in a clear way. You'll learn how to put multiple metrics in a single report, calculate ratios and percentages, and compare global and specific metrics.

Finally, we'll talk about comparing different business groups in a single report, and we'll show youthree methodsof doing this so you can always pick the best solution based on the result you want to achieve.

Once you finish the course, you'll be able to create a wide range of simple SQL reports, organize long queries, include multiple metrics in a single query, and operate on a database with several tables.

In this online course, you'll learn how to build complex aggregations with PostgreSQL window functions: OVER, RANK, PARTITION BY. Note: This is the only online course on PostgreSQL window functions you can find on the Internet.","This online course will be of interest to database analysts, students, developers, and more. The prerequisite for the course is knowing thebasics of SQL. Scroll down for more details.

Window functions (also known as analytic functions or OVER functions) are a very useful tool, especially when it comes to data aggregation. PostgreSQL's documentation describes the concept of window functions rather well:

A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, the use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row – the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

These functions were introduced into the standard relatively recently, and that's whythere are not many online courses that cover this concept.Fortunately, this course does!

This online course covers the syntax and semantics of PostgreSQL window functions and showcases how tremendously powerful they are. After you complete the course, you'll know the typical use cases of window functions, how to use OVER, ORDER BY and PARTITION BY to structure a frame, and the difference between ROWS and RANGE clauses.

Recursive queries are often called WITH clauses and are essentially just named subqueries. It is a fairly new feature of SQL that allows you to manage a long query and break it into smaller, more readable chunks. Unlike SQL subqueries, recursive queries allow the traversal of hierarchical models with enormous depth. Using recursive queries, you can process hierarchical structures, such as graphs and trees; for example, you can find the shortest path between two cities using a railway network or the length of the ""chain of command"" from a regular employee to the CEO.

In this online course, you will learn simple, common table expressions (CTEs), nested CTEs, and recursive CTEs. You will also discover how to manage a PostgreSQL query with a CTE, when to nest CTEs, and how to use recursive CTEs to move through hierarchical data models.

This is an interactive course for intermediate SQL users who know the basics of SQL. We assume that you can write a SELECT query and know how to use GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses. Cool. But why stop learning now? You have so many possibilities!

If you're a complete beginner, don't worry. Just start with theSQL Basics in PostgreSQL courseand come back here later.

After learning the basics of SQL, the next step to proficiency in SQL is to learn built-in functions that come with your database. A function is a predefined piece of code that performs a specific task. You likely know aggregate functions likeCOUNT(),SUM(), orAVG()that compute simple statistics.

Database engines have many more built-in functions. Functions extend the functionality of basic SQL and allow you to perform frequently-used operations on data. This enables you to work more effectively, write more sophisticated SQL queries, and take full advantage of the opportunities offered by databases.

In this course, you will learn about functions in PostgreSQL (version 9 and up). PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is one of the most popular free and open-source database management systems.

As indicated by popularity rankings, PostgreSQL is still gaining more fans. Last year it gained more users than one of the market leaders—Microsoft SQL Server. Interest in Postgres is also reflected in the growing number of job offers for developers and analysts.

This online course is intended for intermediate users. It will be beneficial for beginner data analysts, students, and programmers working with PostgreSQL databases on a daily basis. To make the most of this course, it would be helpful for you to know the topics from ourSQL Basics in PostgreSQL coursein advance.

Ready to take your PostgreSQL skills to the next level? Discover some of the more advanced SQL features! In this interactive course, you'll learn how to use ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS operations in PostgreSQL.

ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause that allows you to attach additional lines which represent subtotals. They are often calledsuper-aggregatedrows. They can be presented together with the total sum line. Thanks to the useful ROLLUP extension, you can generate multiple grouping sets using just one SQL query. Pretty convenient, don't you think?

Perhaps you need to generate subtotals? This is where the CUBE extension comes in handy. Use it in your query to get the subtotals for all combinations of grouping columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.

GROUPING SETS is another step further because it allows for computing multiple GROUP BY clauses in a single SQL statement. GROUP BY GROUPING SETS is equivalent to the UNION of two or more GROUP BY operations in the same result set.

No knowledge will be of any use if you cannot put it into practice. Therefore, this course consists of great interactive exercises on GROUP BY extensions. This will give you the necessary practical experience to help you work with PostgreSQL in your projects. It's full of hands-on experience! Learn at your own pace.

In this course, you will learn the basics of creating and modifying tables in relational databases. First, we will show you the syntax of SQL’s CREATE TABLE command. Then you will master how CREATE TABLE works. We will also explain common table constraints: primary keys, foreign keys, and NOT NULL.

When you create a table in a relational database, you should always set up aprimary key. This is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each table row. We will show you how primary keys work and how you can define a single- or multi-column primary key.

Aforeign keyis a column or a set of columns that refers to another table. You will learn how to use these to establish relationships between tables.

Finally, you'll discover how to set up a NOT NULL constraint for a column. NOT NULL forces the user to always give a non-null value for this column.

This interactive tutorial is based onstandard SQLand will give you the necessary foundation to work with any relational database engine. The syntax for CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE commands will work in all popular relational database management systems, including SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

SQL for Data Analysis,https://learnsql.com/track/sql-for-data-analysis/,,Standard SQL,48,Track,Learn how to use SQL for data analysis. This learning track is carefully crafted to include topics relevant to data analysis,"This SQL learning track is designed to help beginners become proficient data analysts using SQL. Even if you've never used SQL before, this learning path is for you. It covers the most important concepts useful in data analysis: from foundational concepts of SQL, through  manipulating data to writing complex SQL reports using advanced SQL constructions.

## What is SQL

SQL, orStructured Query Language, is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating data in databases. In data analysis, SQL allows analysts to retrieve, filter, and analyze vast amounts of data stored in databases. By writing specific commands called queries, analysts can extract meaningful insights, generate reports, and make data-driven decisions.

If you’re new to SQL, check out ourSQL Primerwhich provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundational concepts of SQL. We also recommend our articleBest Way to Learn SQLwhich offers guidance on the most effective strategies and resources to accelerate your learning journey.

## What is data analysis

Data analysis is the process of reviewing, cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data in order to discover meaningful insights, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. Using data analytical tools and techniques, you can find patterns, trends, and relationships in your data. Once this useful information is extracted, businesses and organizations can then make better decisions, streamline procedures, and address issues.

## Why is SQL important for data analysis?

SQL is important for data analysis because it provides a standardized language for searching, manipulating, and combining data from databases and other data sources. It helps analysts to obtain, convert, and aggregate data in an efficient manner, allowing them to extract insights and make informed decisions based on the data.

Let's look at some of the reasons why SQL is useful for data analysis:

- **Data Retrieval**– SQL lets people quickly get data from databases. It gives a neat way to ask for and get data using different rules, like filtering by certain criteria, sorting results, and choosing certain information. This makes it easy for people to get the data they need.

- **Data Manipulation**– SQL offers advanced tools to work with data. People can use it to do computations, modify data, or combine data sets coming from different sources. SQL lets you do many things with data, like aggregation or grouping, joining tables, and doing sophisticated calculations. This helps data analysts prepare data for analysis.

- **Data Integration**– SQL is essential for integrating data from various sources. To undertake complete analysis,analysts frequently need to merge data from multiple datasets. SQL has special tools to join data from different sources. This functionality makes complex datasets easier to analyze.

- **Data Aggregation and Summarization**– SQL has many ways to aggregate and summarize data. People can use it to find things like totals, sums, averages, and maximum or minimum values.. They can use these tools to learn from the data and make summary reports that provide overview of data.

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**– Before doing data analysis, data is often cleaned and transformed to verify its quality. SQL has ways to help with cleaning tasks like removing duplicates, dealing with missing values, and data formatting. People can use SQL commands to modify data and make sure it's correct and consistent.

- **Standardization**– SQL is popular, highly scalable, and supported by most data technologies.  This means people can use SQL to work with many different data technologies. It helps when switching between systems  and working with others.

Do you work with relational databases? Want to learn how to create tables, views, and indexes? This track is especially for you. It will help you understand the technical side of data storage and learn how to manage it more efficiently.

In this track, you will learn SQL’s Data Definition Language (DDL) - the syntax used to create, modify, and remove tables, views, and indexes. To get the most out of it, you should know the basics of SQL, especially the DML (data manipulation language) part. We assume that you know when to use SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

(If you’re not familiar with the above SQL commands, start with ourHow to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data in SQLcourse and then come back to this one.)

Creating Database Structureconsists of five interactive courses. The first two deal with creating tables: you’ll learn the basic syntax of CREATE TABLE, uncover different data types, and learn how to select the right data types for your needs. The third course delves into constraints, or how databases verify the correctness of data. The last two courses will teach you how to work with views and indexes.

After completing this track, you'll know how to create, modify, and remove database objects.

All courses in the track are based on standard SQL. That means that you will be able to use the skills acquired here in almost any relational database management system (RDMS), including Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
We believe people learn best through practice and interactive tasks. So, during this course, you’ll write real SQL commands directly in the browser.
